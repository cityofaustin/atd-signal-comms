# atd-signal-comms

The Austin Transportation Department manages thousands of IP-enabled devices which enable traffic signal operations. Devices include traffic cameras, battery backup systems, signal controllers, and vehicle detectors.

This repository hosts tools for logging the status of the various devices on the traffic signals network and publishing these records to a [public dataset](https://data.austintexas.gov/Transportation-and-Mobility/Traffic-Signal-Network-Device-Status-Log/pj7k-98z2/data) so that they can be incorprated into reporting and analysis tools.

## Design

![process flow](flow.jpg)

The basic flow is managed by two scripts.

### Device comm status check (`run_comm_check.py`)

1. Device asset records are downloaded from ATD's Knack data store via [atd-knack-services](https://github.com/cityofaustin/atd-knack-services).
2. Devices are pinged asynchronously and the outcome is stored in-memory
3. Once all devicess have been pinged, the results are uploaded as a JSON blob to S3.
4. Records are stored in S3 using the path pattern `/<environment>/<device-type>/<year>/<month>/YYYY-MM-DD.json`

### Publish to Open Data Portal (`socrata_pub.py`)

Given a start date, end date, and device type, files which match the given date range and device type are downloaded from S3 and published to Socrata. Each file is downloaded then published before the next file is downloaded.

This tool is designed to minimize costs by using Amazon S3 as a central data store. Records are stored in S3 using the path pattern `/<environment>/<device-type>/<year>/<month>/YYYY-MM-DD.json`

Idempotency is achieved by assigning each record a unique id generated by concatenating the device's unique ID, device type, and millisecond timestamp and using Socrata's [upsert](https://dev.socrata.com/publishers/soda-producer/upsert.html) method when publishing. There is no risk in duplicating records by re-running `socrata_pub.py` for an arbitrary time frame.

## Installation

In your own Python environment:

```shell
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

or Docker

```shell
$ docker build -t atd-signal-comms .
```

## Configuration

Each device type to be pinged must have an entry defined in `config.CONFIG`.

- `device_type`: A unique `str` identifier the device type.
- `container`: A Knack object or view key from which device asset records will be fetched.
- `fields`: a `dict` of field mappings which will be used to translate Knack fields to canonical field names. At a minimum, all devices must have an `ip_address` and `device_id` field. See `config.SCHEMA` for requirements of field values.

```python
    # config.py
    CONFIG = {
        "device_type": "camera",
        "container": "view_3059",
        "fields": {
            "ip_address": "field_638",
            "device_id": "field_947",
            "location_id": "field_732",
            "location_name": "field_211",
            "knack_id": "id",
        },
        # ...
    }
```

### Environmental settings

A `dev` and `prod` environment are supported. `dev` is the default environment `prod` can be set using CLI args (see: [Usage](#usage)). On S3, all files are nested under the `dev` or `prod` prefix. The production and dev Socrata dataset identifiers are defined in `settings.SOCRATA_RESOURCE_ID`.

The following environment variables are required:

- `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`: The AWS access key ID
- `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`: The AWS access key secret
- `BUCKET`: The S3 bucket name
- `KNACK_APP_ID`: The Knack App ID of source Knack the application (the AMD Data Tracker)
- `PGREST_JWT`: The PostgREST token for [atd-knack-services](https://github.com/cityofaustin/atd-knack-services) instance
- `PGREST_ENDPOINT`: The PostgREST endpoint for fetching device records, powered by [atd-knack-services](https://github.com/cityofaustin/atd-knack-services).
- `SOCRATA_API_KEY_ID`: The Socrata API key of the account you need to access
- `SOCRATA_API_KEY_SECRET`: The Socrata API key secret
- `SOCRATA_APP_TOKEN`: The Socrata app token

### Validation

`run_comm_check.py` relies on [Cerberus](https://docs.python-cerberus.org/en/stable/index.html) to validate the JSON before upload to S3. The schema is defined in `config.SCHEMA`.

### Settings

The following settings are defined in `settings.py`:

- `MAX_ATTEMPTS` (`int`): The maximum number of attempts to ping a device before giving up.
- `NUM_WORKERS_DEFAULT` (`int`): The default number of concurrent workers.
- `TIMEOUT` (`int`): The default ping timeout in seconds. Can be overwritten with CLI arg
- `SOCRATA_RESOURCE_ID` (`str`): The unique ID of the destination Socrata dataset

## Usage

### run_comm_check.py

Async ping a group of devices and upload results to S3 bucket.

```shell
$ run_comm_check.py camera -e dev -w 100 -v
```

#### Positional arguments:

- Device type (`str`): The type of device to ping. Valid device types are defined in `config.CONFIG`.

#### Optional arguments:

- `-e`, `--env`: The environment name (`dev` or `prod`). Defaults to `dev`.
- `-t`, `--timeout`:The ping timeout in seconds. Defaults to `settings.TIMEOUT_DEFAULT`.
- `-w`, `--workers`: The number of concurrent workers which will ping devices. Defaults to `settings.NUM_OF_WORKERS`.
- `-v`, `--verbose`: Sets logger to `DEBUG` level

### socrata_pub.py

Download files from S3 and published to Socrata.

```shell
$ socrata_pub.py camera -e dev --start 2021-01-01 --end 2021-10-31 -v
```

#### Positional arguments:

- Device type (`str`): The type of device to ping. Valid device types are defined in `config.CONFIG`.

#### Optional arguments:

- `-e`, `--env`: The environment name (`dev` or `prod`). Defaults to `dev`.
- `--start`: UTC date (format: `YYYY-MM-DD`) of earliest records to be fetched. Defaults to the current date.
- `--end`: UTC date (format: `YYYY-MM-DD`) of oldest records to be fetched. Defaults to the current date.
- `-v`, `--verbose`: Sets logger to `DEBUG` level


## Development

A new Docker image is pushed to Docker hub via Github action on any push to `production` or `staging`.
